  <h3><a name="genimg">
    Version 6 images
  </h3>

  <p>
    In order to see images for version 6 games, you will requires the
    resources in Blorb format: Zoom does not support any other format
    for images. All new games should come with images in this
    format. For the old infocom games, Blorb versions of the game
    resources are available from the IF-Archive, at
    <a
    href="http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXmedia.html">http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXmedia.html</a>.
    See the sections on configuration for information on how to get
    Zoom to load these resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    Zoom does not support JPEG images: there are currently patent
    issues with this format.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="genfont">
    Fonts
  </h3>

  <p>
    Some version 6 games may not deal with proportional fonts
    adequately: if you find a game is drawing text in the wrong place,
    try using a fixed pitch font for the 'roman' style.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="osx">
    Mac OS X

  <h3><a name="macdata">
    Infocom data files
  </h3>

  <p>
    The Macintosh version of the Infocom games are distributed as a
    package containing both the interpreter and the data. In order to
    run these games under Zoom, you will need to seperate the data
    from the program. Fortunately, that isn't hard. To do the
    conversion, copy the game to the desktop, then fire up a Terminal
    session and use the following commands:
  </p>

  <pre>
cp &quot;~/Desktop/GAME&quot; &quot;~/Desktop/GAME.z5&quot;
  </pre>

  <p>
    (Substituting the name of the game for GAME). The file 'GAME.z5'
    will now just contain the data, and you should be able to
    double-click it to load it into Zoom. This technique may also work
    for other files that you know are Z-Code files, but that you are
    unable to open in Zoom for some reason.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="defterp">
    Making Zoom the default interpreter
  </h3>

  <p>
    If you have another interpreter installed, it may be set as the
    default editor for Infocom files: this means that when you open a
    game in the finder, that other interpreter loads instead of
    Zoom. If you want Zoom to be the default interpreter for a game
    (or for all games), select that game in the finder, choose 'Show
    Info' (Command-I, or from the File menu), and choose Zoom from the
    'Open with Application' dialog. Click 'Change All' to set Zoom as
    the default interpreter for all games of this type.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="osxfonts">
    Fonts
  </h3>

  <p>
    Zoom offers both QuickDraw and Quartz font rendering. Unicode is
    supported in both systems. The Quartz system is, however, somewhat
    slower than its QuickDraw equivalent (partly due to the lack of
    adequate functions for measuring text dimensions).
  </p>

  <h3><a name="osximg">
    Images
  </h3>

  <p>
    (This only applies to people compiling Zoom)
  </p>

  <p>
    If image quality is low, this may be because your version of Zoom
    was compiled using QuickTime to draw its images. This happens if
    Zoom was compiled without libpng available: it is highly
    recommended to install libpng if you are compiling under Mac OS X
    (binary releases have libpng built-in, so this won't be an issue).
  </p>

  <h2><a name="xwin">
    X-Windows
  </h2>

  <h3><a name="xwinimg">
    Images
  </h3>

  <p>
    When you compile Zoom, make sure that libpng is available, or
    image support will be disabled.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you find image rendering is slow, make sure that optimisation
    was turned on when you compiled Zoom. <code>./configure
    CFLAGS=-O9</code> will always do the trick. If you find images are
    still too slow, you may find that undefining QUALITY_HIGH at the
    start of image_libpng.c has some effect on the speed.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="xwinfont">
    Fonts
  </h3>

  <p>
    The font situation under X-Windows is slightly confused. The
    standard X font system (which Zoom prefers to use as a last
    resort) does not support anti-aliasing or Unicode. Xft is the
    preferred rendering system: it has full support for Unicode, it's
    fast and it's flexible. Unfortunately, it might require some
    configuration on your system. If games render strangely, it may be
    that Xft is not set up, and is using daft defaults for the fixed
    pitch fonts.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have problems with the font rendering, it might well be
    Xft. To check this, set 'antialias' to 'no' in the .zoomrc file
    and see if that solves the problem. If it does, it may be worth
    taking the time to set up Xft properly (if you use KDE, this will
    also allow you to use the antialiased fonts there).
  </p>

  <p>
    Xft is set up through the configuration file 'XftConfig'. If you
    have X installed under /usr/X11R6/, this should be in
    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/ by default. A minimal file might be:
  </p>

  <pre>
dir &quot;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType&quot;
dir &quot;/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1&quot;
  </pre>

  <p>
    Remove the first line if you don't have a TrueType font directory
    in your installation. See <a
    href="http://keithp.com/~keithp/fonts/XftConfig">http://keithp.com/~keithp/fonts/XftConfig</a>
    for a larger example of an XftConfig file. Most X11 distributions
    should have a courier font in the Type1 directory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Zoom sometimes has trouble calculating the screen metrics for a
    T1Lib font. This is not usually noticable, but it does mean that
    you should not use T1Lib for the fixed pitch fonts, and it creates
    a glitch on the status bar in Infocom's Arthur (T1Lib fonts are
    specified by filename rather than by their X font specifier).
  </p>

  <h2><a name="older">
    Older versions
  </h2>

  <p>
    This section lists some problems with older versions of Zoom.
  </p>

  <h3>1.0.1beta2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Text rendered as gobbledegook when Quartz was turned on (only
      certain fonts)
    <li>Font preview in preferences rendered in the wrong colours (OS X)
    <li>Rendering with fonts of different sizes leaves 'gaps' (OS X)
    <li>Alphabet table ignored in version 6 games
    <li>Alphabet table ignored when caching abbreviations
    <li>ZSCII-to-Zcharacter table not always set up properly (breaks
      command parsing in Shogun, or the german version of Zork)
    <li>Occasional crash if a gamedir was set without a savedir
    <li>Displays with Xft but without XDBE fail to draw input text
    <li>'Please enter filename' messages displayed after the
      save/open dialog has completed (Mac OS X)
  </ul>

  <h3>1.0.1beta1</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Spec 1.1 errors:
      <ul>
        <li>New header extension words not implemented
	<li>@save/@restore always prompt
	<li>@sound_data is not a branch instruction (will crash the
	  game)
	<li>Unicode strings sometimes cut out some characters
	<li>Truecolour in the upper window is a bit kronky
	  (Z-Machine versions other than 6)
	<li>Unicode string decoder sometimes returns negative values,
	  leading to occasional missing characters when plotting to the
	  upper window (not v6)
      </ul>
    <li>@set_font doesn't update v6 structures correctly
    <li>@read_mouse doesn't store coordinates correctly
    <li>@erase_picture always erases to white, and not the background
      colour
    <li>APal blorb extension ignored
    <li><code>antialias</code> option does not disable Xft. (Comment
      out <code>#define HAVE_XFT</code> in config.h and recompile to
      disable Xft in this revision).
    <li>Display drivers not reporting that they support pictures
    <li>X-Windows version blinks cursor even when it doesn't have
      focus
    <li>Quartz renderer renders with common ligatures - 'fi' ligature
      often makes a mess of the upper window in version 5 games.
  </ul>
