 * Tidy up display sub-system code:
    * System-specific globals sometimes don't follow any sort of sane
      naming convention (even compared to say, the file-management
      functions)
    * Need to distinguish layout functions (in display.c and layout.c)
      from system-specific ones
    * Need to sort out the naming of things like the 'text' structure
      (layout_text?)
 * Copy/paste
