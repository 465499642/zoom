GENERAL:

 * Crash with graphics set to a directory?
 * Allow for graphics directories
 * Hang with Xft2 (appears to be a bug in Xft2 rather than Zoom)
 * Extra Zork II / Plundered Hearts definitions
 * taipan.z5 text display underneath upper window bug
 * [More] and recorded scripts broken?
 * Option to turn on debugging mode for Mac OS X
 * heirarchical fonts
 * reset pixmap display on restart under v6
 * XSL documentation
 * disable quicktime rendering
 * crash when moving a file and it's resources in OS X?
 * Remove font numbering
 * '>>' '<<' bug? again?
 
 COCOA:
 * Cocoa version has the restart bug again (erg)
 * Problem with overwriting things in the upper window? (Beyond Zork)
 * upper window behaviour really needs to change:
    - slowdown when the lower window gets full? (FIXED, I think)
    - Really, upper window things pasted onto the lower window need to have an
      'attached character', so they move correctly when the window is resized
    - readline in upper window?
 * line editing (up/down arrows)
 * Fullscreen mode
 * Ability to reformat display
 * crash when running spacest2.z5?

FUTURE:
 * Sound
 * Internationalisation support
 * One-shot warning messages
 * Tidy up display sub-system code:
    * System-specific globals sometimes don't follow any sort of sane
      naming convention (even compared to say, the file-management
      functions)
    * Need to distinguish layout functions (in display.c and layout.c)
      from system-specific ones
    * Need to sort out the naming of things like the 'text' structure
      (layout_text?)
 * Copy/paste (implemented in the Cocoa version)
 * Way of changing default foreground/background colours
