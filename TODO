Hmm, this file was a bit out of date.

 * Crash with graphics set to a directory?
 * Allow for graphics directories
 * Hang with Xft2 (appears to be a bug in Xft2 rather than Zoom)
 * Extra Zork II / Plundered Hearts definitions
 * taipan.z5 text display underneath upper window bug
 * [More] and recorded scripts broken?
 * Option to turn on debugging mode for Mac OS X
 * heirarchical fonts
 * reset pixmap display on restart under v6
 * XSL documentation
 * disable quicktime rendering
 * crash when moving a file and it's resources in OS X?

 * Sound
 * Internationalisation support
 * One-shot warning messages
 * Tidy up display sub-system code:
    * System-specific globals sometimes don't follow any sort of sane
      naming convention (even compared to say, the file-management
      functions)
    * Need to distinguish layout functions (in display.c and layout.c)
      from system-specific ones
    * Need to sort out the naming of things like the 'text' structure
      (layout_text?)
 * Copy/paste
 * Way of changing default foreground/background colours
