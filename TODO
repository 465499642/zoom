Hmm, this file was a bit out of date.

 X click on colour sample problem
 X Resizing of carbon prefs dialog
 X font redraw problem under Carbon
 X insta-changes for preferences
 X save window size under Carbon
 X text corruption under Shogun
 X Zork Zero colour changing
 X bug with XDBE and v6 games
 X 'MORE' not displayed in Shogun
 X sigh, creating files under Carbon still broken (set file type)
 X segfault on window resize occasionally
 * problem with resize when 'MORE' is displayed.
 * startup message
 * Colour preference thing
 * warning for non-fixed font set as fixed font
 * reset pixmap display on restart under v6
 * drag and drop support for file loading
