2000-11-10  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

	doesn't exist. Fixed.

2000-11-09  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

        * bug fixed in xdisplay.c that caused the cursor to slowly
	creep across the screen in Border Zone

	Changed this condition to a warning instead of a fatal error

	commandline

	* version changed to 0.9.99dev5

	* changed builder to new format. Now uses gotos rather than calling
	subroutines. This is a manual inlining of the functions - we get the
	speed increases encountered before, but without the compiler
	problems, or the size increase. Standard speed of the interpreter
	is just over twice the speed of frotz (2.32). The new format of
	the zcode.ops file removed the need for op.c altogether.

	routines

	* bugfixes: transcript now works when header bit is
	set. Seastalker window display fixed. Undo no longer leaks
	memory. zoomrc file added to tarball. Save/restore now print
	reasons when they fail. Output stream 3 fixed to comply better
	with specification.

	* version changed to 0.9.99dev3
