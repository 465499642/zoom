29/06/2002:
	Plenty of work on the Unix/Linux version: the display code has
	been rewritten, which might make porting easier, but more
	importantly means that scrollback is now supported in this
	port. Support for T1Lib and Xft has also been added, which
	improves the quality of the display immeasurably (if you like
	anti-aliasing at any rate).

	Started work on a symbolic debug mode. Should make a nice
	complement to Infix.
